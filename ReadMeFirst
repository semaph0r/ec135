This Model of an Eurocopter EC135 is made for FlightGear and stands under the terms of GPLv2.

This model is standing under heavily work progress so please accept that there are a lot of thing which might not working as you want. 
For updates use the CVS-version and read the CVS-logs and some threads in the officiasl FlightGear Forum!

Im still looking for the Operations manual and a lots of datas about the airfoils!
The current fdm is just a guess and might be not that realistic.
